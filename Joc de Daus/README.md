# Dice Game

This project is a dice game built with Spring Boot, employing JWT for user authentication and authorization. It enables users to sign up, log in, and play dice.

This game involves rolling two dice. If the sum equals 7, the player wins; otherwise, they lose. To play, users must register with a unique email and player name. If no name is provided, the user will be named "ANONYMOUS".
